# GSoC 2025 Proposal – EEG-Based Cognitive State and Alzheimer's Risk Detection

This repository is for my GSoC 2025 proposal under **INCF**, focused on analyzing EEG data using machine learning to detect cognitive states and early indicators of Alzheimer's Disease.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project involves building a pipeline that:
- Processes raw EEG signals
- Classifies cognitive states like focus, distraction, and fatigue
- Identifies patterns that may indicate early cognitive decline
- Aims to support early Alzheimer’s detection using open datasets

## 📅 Timeline Highlights
- Preprocess and segment EEG signals
- Train ML models on cognitive state classification
- Explore biomarkers linked to Alzheimer’s
- Visualize results in Jupyter Notebooks or a lightweight dashboard

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, MNE-Python
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit (optional)
- EEG datasets from PhysioNet, OpenNeuro, Mendeley

## 🌟 Why This Project?
I’m passionate about neuroscience and applying ML to health. This project lets me explore both, while contributing something meaningful to open science.
